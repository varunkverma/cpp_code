Types of Iteratorts:

1. Input - Only read is allowed

2. Output - Only write is allowed

3. Forward - Have capabilities of both Input and Output iterators. Move forward only.

4. Bidirectional - Have capabilities of Forward iterator. Move in both directions.

5. Random - Have capabilities of Bidirectional iterator. Random access. Compare two iterators.


Iterators with Containers:

-> Simple Containers
    #   forward_list(linked list) - Forward
    #   list(doubly linked list) - Bidirectional
    #   vector - Random

-> Associative Containers
    #   set - Bidirectional
    #   map - Bidirectional
    #   multimap - Bidirectional
    #   multiset - Bidirectional
    #   unordered_set - Forward
    #   unordered_map - Forward

-> Adaptor Containers
    #   queue - Do not have iterators
    #   stack - Do not have iterators
    #   priority_queue - Do not have iterators

Note: Input iterator w.r.t the prev, next and advance functions
    # input iterator is of Random access - O(1)
    # input iterator is of foward access - O(n), n is positive
    # input iterator is of bidirectional access - O(n), n is positive or negative
